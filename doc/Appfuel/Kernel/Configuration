Configuration in appfuel is broken down into two categories: PHP configuration
and User configuration. All configuration in appfuel follow these rules:
a)	Config data can be stored in files located at app/config 		
b)	Config data can also be passed in manually as an array
c)	Once obtained config data is kept in a configuration registry.
d)	A config handler will run all config strategies known as tasks.
e)	A config task is a class that encapsulates the logic needed to apply
	its particular configuration.
f)	A config task defines the keys it uses in the registry.
g)	The PHP configuration strategy names are kept in the handler
h)	The user configuration strategy names are kept in the config data,
	stored as a list of class names which are the fully qualified class
	names of the strategies the handler will run
i)	The handler runs through all php strategies then all user strategies
j)	The handler will collect data from the registry as specified by keys
    defined in the strategy.
k)  The handler will also pass in the route detail and the context
l)	After processing, the handler will ask the strategy for its status,
	storing a list of strategy status messages which may be used in debugging
