Module Responsiblilties:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary responsiblilty of the Stdlib short for standard library is to 
provide a uniform interface for php or the os lower level functionality. The 
reason for this is rooted in two main problems:
	
	1)	Most low level operations like file copy or cli terminal getOpts 
		get repeated in the code base over and over with varying degrees
		of error checking comments etc... We try to solve this problem
		by providing a standard approach to reduce duplication in the code.

	2)	When faced with change it is a tedious effort to hunt down all the 
		individual calls to and make modifications on a case by case basis
		vs applying a design pattern to a well establish and tested module.

The aim of the standard library is not wrap every php function but rather
to provide a set of general modules that can be easily tested and changed
responsibly.


Module List:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Filesystem:	Filesystem operations such as move, copy, delete etc...

Data:		Standardize general list operations. We are not wrapping arrays
			directory, these are iterators etc ...

Console:	Commandline terminal operations
